give me a description of the system for the readme
Absolutely! Here's a detailed description for your README file:

Text Processing Pipeline
This project implements a configurable, recursive text processing pipeline capable of handling various text analysis tasks. The pipeline is designed to be highly flexible and extensible, allowing for multiple stages of preprocessing, analysis, and post-processing, with dynamic function calls and parameter handling.

Features
Configurable Stages: The pipeline is divided into three main stages: Preprocessing, Analysis, and Post-Processing. Each stage can be configured independently using a JSON file.

Recursive Structure: Supports nested configurations for handling multiple component extractions, such as multiple pipelines within a single configuration.

Dynamic Function Calls: Functions are dynamically called based on their names specified in the configuration file. This allows for easy integration of functions defined in additional Python files.

Parameter Handling: Each function can accept parameters specified in the configuration file, making the pipeline adaptable to various processing needs.

Metrics and Validation: The pipeline includes metrics to determine if the results meet the desired standards. If the results do not meet the specified thresholds, the pipeline will re-process the data up to a maximum number of attempts.

Logging: Comprehensive logging is implemented to track the process and capture errors. This includes a full log of all steps and errors, aiding in debugging and monitoring.

Configuration
The pipeline's behavior is defined using a JSON configuration file. Hereâ€™s an example configuration:

Logging and Error Handling
Logs: The system logs all steps, including preprocessing, analysis, and post-processing steps, along with errors and warnings. Logs are written to pipeline.log.

Error Handling: If a task fails to meet the specified metrics after a maximum number of attempts, an error message is logged.

Adding New Functions
To add new functions, you can define them in additional Python files and include these files in the additional_files list in the configuration. The pipeline will dynamically load and use these functions based on the configuration.
